# \#0: ðŸ’ƒ Introduction

Angular is much more than a framework. It's a whole platform for creating applications that can run anywhere, not only on a browser. It gives you tools with advanced capabilities such as easily creating dynamic components, route definitions and much more.

In this tutorial you'll learn how to develop a basic application using Angular. You will get to know the building blocks required to have a working application: modules, components and services. The Angular CLI will help speed up the development process by providing you with useful commands and tools.

## Our goal

By the end of this tutorial you'll have a ready todo-list application. It will show a list of items and let you add or delete them. You will even be able to change the title of an existing item.

The list is saved in the browser's local storage. All of the changes you make will remain even when you refresh the browser or even turn off your computer \(as long as you use the same browser on the same computer and not in private mode\).

You will even publish the application on the Web, so that others can use it!

## And afterwards?

After completing this tutorial, we encourage you to continue developing the application and adding your own personal touch.

This tutorial is meant for beginners and will try to address good practices, but due to its simplicity it's not always possible.

We really hope this tutorial will help you in your first stages of Web development using Angular!

Enjoy!
